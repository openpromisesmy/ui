          <h1>What would we use funding for?</h1>
          <p>
            Tracking promises is a time consuming process. Our team of trackers consists of volunteers - while we strive to ensure consistency, work and study commitments may mean delays in processing updates. By hiring a full-time tracker, we can
            <b>manage the tracking process quicker and increase the frequency of updates.</b>
          </p>
          <p>In addition, developing new website features and tracking tools will be accelerated with proper funding. We also need funding to get access to paid media sources which will help us verify promises faster. Here is a list of the uses of funds:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hiring a full-time tracker - RM 1,800 / month</li>
            <li>Full text search capabilities - 29 USD / month</li>
            <li>Security tools - 25 USD / month (there are certain security tools that we can use to ensure the platform is more secure against attacks)</li>
          </ul>
