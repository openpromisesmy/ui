            <h2>The problem ?</h2>
            <p>The feedback loop for representative democracies is broken. Politicians gain support from citizens not just based on track records but also heavily based on promises that they make. The fulfilment of these promises are currently not tracked in a systematic way.</p>

            <h2>The solution ?</h2>
            <p>A resource and platform that empowers citizens with easy access to the track record of promises made and their fulfilment: OpenPromises.</p>

            <h2>What do you mean by promises ?</h2>
            <p>Promises are plans of actions that can be carried out by people in office. It can be a one-off action or a policy change.</p>

            <h2>Who are we funded by ?</h2>
            <p>Currently we have 44 USD/month funding from our community members that covers our current monthly expenses. For a year before we had crowdfunding, we also used some of our personal money to for expenses incurred by the website and its setting up. As it stands, we are 100% citizen-funded through Patreon. Decentralised funding means we cannot be easily influenced or corrupted.</p>

            <h2>What would we use funding for?</h2>
            <p>Tracking is a very time consuming process and a more developed backend system can cut down the time needed to process promises. Development of the website and tracking tools will be accelerated with proper funding. We also need funding to get access to paid media sources which will help us verify promises faster. Here is a list of the more immediate uses of funds:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Full text search capabilities - 29 USD/month</li>
              <li>Security tools - 25 USD/month (there are certain security tools that we can use to ensure the platform is more secure against attacks)</li>
            </ul>
