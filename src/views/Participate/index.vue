    <h1>Join the discussion</h1>
    <p>As you may already know, we are a not for profit project centred around the tracking of promises by politicians. Weâ€™re 100% independent (self sustaining funding) and have no political affiliations.</p>

    <p>A very important aspect of the project is community engagement. We want to do our best in providing platforms so that citizens like you can have platforms to have meaningful discussions.</p>

    <p>One of the ways we do that is by having state groups where you can post about promises relating to the state.</p>

    In the group, you can:
    <ul>
    <li>Post news articles regarding promises</li>
    <li>Bring up promises that have progress or have not had - progress</li>
    <li>Engage with other citizens on relevant topics</li>
    </ul>
